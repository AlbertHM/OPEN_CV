For the addition of image we can utilize both OpenCV and Numpy Array Operations 
cv2.add() [It is a saturation operaion]
res= img1 + img 2 [It is a modulo operation]
>>> x = np.uint8([250])
>>> y = np.uint8([10])
>>> print cv2.add(x,y) # 250+10 = 260 => 255
[[255]]
>>> print x+y
[4]
# 250+10 = 260 % 256 = 4
It will be more visible when you add two images. OpenCV function will provide a better result. So always better stick
to OpenCV functions.
To add two images they must have same depth and type
